Iâ€™m a software developer who enjoys working with AI, backend systems, and âš¡ blazingly fast âš¡ web stacks. Most of my projects revolve around building efficient APIs, experimenting with data processing and modeling, and trying out new frameworks.  

I use **BASE** Stack the most for my Fullstack Dev, consisting of Bun, Astro, Supabase, and ElysiaJS. On the side, I like working with robotics and machine learing for fun.
